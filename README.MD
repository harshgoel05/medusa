# 🚀 Medusa Demo Project 🌐

This repository comprises three essential components: `medusademo`, `medusademo-storefront`, and `sanitymedusa`. Together, they form the Medusa Demo Project. The development workflow is streamlined with the Yarn package manager. 🛠️💻

## Prerequisites 🌟

Before diving into the project, make sure you have the Medusa CLI installed globally. Use the following command:

```bash
yarn global add @medusajs/medusa-cli
```

# Running the Project 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️

Follow these straightforward steps to get the project up and running locally:

1. **Navigate to `medusademo` folder:**
   ```bash
   cd medusademo
   yarn install
   yarn dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to `medusademo-storefront` folder:**
   ```bash
   cd medusademo-storefront
   yarn install
   yarn dev
